Help Ishaan

Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher.
He needs to find the Nth term of a series.
His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below).
He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him
that the Nth term is related to prime numbers.
The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N.
Help him find the Nth term for a given N.


Example 1:

Input: N = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: Closest prime to 10 is 11.

Example 2:

Input: N = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: Closest prime to 7 is 7.



Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function NthTerm() which takes N as
input paramater and returns Nth term.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N* âˆš N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
